Thank you speaker!

We really appreaciate the time and effort you put into preparing and presenting your session.

To share with the community, may we ask you to provide your session materials as reference?

Session materials include:

* any demo materials

To maximize transparency we have put together some guideliness.

## The guideliness

We appreciate you provide your session materials using the following directory structure:
``` 
<meetup>\<your session>\
    |
    ----- <session title - speaker name>. ppt|pdf
    |
    ----- <demo01>
