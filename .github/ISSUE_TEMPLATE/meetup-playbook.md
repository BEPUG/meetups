# Belgian PowerShell meetup tasklist

## Introduction

Issues in the meetup repository are used to help organize and setup a meetup.
You can use the following checklist to organize the next in-person meetup.

Anything goes as long as it follows a couple of rules:

* it has PowerShell in it :-)
* it respects everybody that is part of our community and beyond.

## Format

Currently we only have one format (in-person) meetups, but as we grow we might extend to different formats like on-line meetups, PowerSHell Saterdays. etc.

### In-person meetups

Our primary focus when organizing meetups.
Currently we see the format as:

* 2 main sessions (30-45min)
* 3 lighting talks (10min)

The lighting talks lower the bar to engage new speakers and build a stronger community.
