# Belgian PowerShell User group Meetups

The Belgian PowerShell user group (BEPUG) brings Belgian PowerShell enthousiast together.  
Our goal is bring people with a powershell interest together so we stimulate learning in a social and open environment.

To support the openness we adopted a [code of conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you have any questions, just reach out to any of the [organizers](.github/AUTHORS.md).

This repository contains all presentations from the past meetups we have had.
