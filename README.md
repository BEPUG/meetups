# Belgian PowerShell User group Meetups

The Belgian PowerShell User Group (BEPUG) has the goal to bring together PowerShell enthousiasts and to stimulate learning in a social and open environment.

To underline our open culture, we adopted a [code of conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you have any questions, just reach out to any of the [organizers](.github/AUTHORS.md).

This repository contains all presentations from the past meetups we have had.
