## Title

Infrastructure-as-Code: VSTS, Azure and the glue of PowerShell

## Speaker

Jeff Wouters

## Abstract

When you manage your IT infrastructure through code, a new way of thinking and working is desired. VSTS as an orchestration tool, PowerShell as a glue and Azure as a platform to receive all the content.  
During this session I'll show you how you can easily set up the basics in this, expand on that and how this can help you convince your management and colleagues to allow / do this.
