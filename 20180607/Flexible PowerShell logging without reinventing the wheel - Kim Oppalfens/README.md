## Speaker

## Abstract

This session will introduce you to a solution to easily introduce logging into your PowerShell scripts without starting from scratch each time. The .Net and Java development worlds have a number of heavily utilized frameworks by millions of developers. The presenter was looking at building his own logging function/module when he stumbled across one of these frameworks called Log4Net. Given the flexibility in there the PowerShell module created was based on Log4Net with some small additions. The result is an easily usable logging solution that should meet most peopleâ€™s needs. This session will introduce you to the basic usage of the module, and explain some of the more advanced scenarios it covers.
