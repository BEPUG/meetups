## Title

Modernizing PowerShell Scripts

## Speaker

## Abstract

I'm in IT, so naturally I am hugely interested in new technologies and developments. Not only within my own area of expertise (system and network engineering) but also more broad (development, machine learning, AI,...).

Despite all that, I find myself sometimes clinging on too hard on "proven technology" and reluctant to implement new solutions to existing problems. Is that bad? Probably not, but some things could probably be done better or more efficient by stepping out of that comfort zone and trying something new. We all hear our developer co-workers complaining about having to maintain "legacy code", or not being able to develop in the latest and greatest framework.

In this session I'd like to talk from personal experience on how I improved my way of working with PowerShell. The following topics will be addressed:

- Getting rid of some bad habits by using best practices.
- PowerShell became PowerShell Core. Is this new version suitable for my needs, and do I need to do anything to adapt my existing scripts?
- Microsoft killed PowerShell ISE. How can Visual Studio Code fill the void in my heart?
- What is GIT? Why do developers seem to love it so much? And how can it help a system engineer such as me?
