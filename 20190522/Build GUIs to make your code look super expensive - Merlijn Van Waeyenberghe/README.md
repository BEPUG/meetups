## Title

Build GUIs to make your code look super expensive

## Speaker

Merlijn Van Waeyenberghe

## Abstract

No matter how well-written your code, most people won’t read it to figure out how to use it. And that’s a shame. Help your peers use the tools you’ve created to help them in the first place!
In this session, I’ll show you how easy it really is to create a simple GUI on top of your existing code, using free or cheap tools, yet making your tool look professional, fancy, expensive or any combination thereof.
